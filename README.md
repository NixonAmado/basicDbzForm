## Guided practice by DevTalles Angular

This practice was to explore the differences and learn about the difficult things in the learning curve, it covered topics such as:
- One way data binding
- Two way data binding
- Services
- Interfaces
- @Input()
- @Output()
- Property binding
- Event binding 
- StandAlone Components
- pipe JSON
- Event Emiter
- attribute // structural directives
- DI 
- UUID

This practice was made with standAlone components, this mini project don´t handle Modules, However, I saw how to manage it with modules.

my next Angular learning will cover StandAlone with Signals
